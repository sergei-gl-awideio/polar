 * Helpers that place PolarDB's main shared-memory segment well on NUMA
 * hardware, applied regardless of how the segment is backed (anonymous mmap or
 * the zero-copy memfd, see polar_zc.h):
 *
 *	- polar_shmem_numa_interleave_range() installs an MPOL_INTERLEAVE policy on
 *	  the whole segment, so its pages are spread evenly across NUMA nodes.
 *
 * Gated by the polar_shmem_numa_interleave PGC_POSTMASTER GUC; Linux-only and
 * best-effort, a no-op elsewhere.
